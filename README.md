# Introduction

From November 2016 till February 2017 Riscure ran the 'first embedded hardware CTF, round two.' also called RHME2. RHME2 is a hardware based CTF where Riscure ships each participant an Arduino Nano board containing a custom bootloader that can be used to flash encrypted challenges to the board. These challenges need to be solved using various hardware and software techniques.

I participated in this CTF and got second place after the HydraBus team. This repository contains [my](https://twitter.com/gijs_h) writeups for the [Riscure RHME2](http://rhme.riscure.com/) Challenge.

# Writeups

The writeups are split up per category:

* [Exploitation](exploit/README.md)
* [Reversing](reversing/README.md)
* [Side channel analysis](sca/README.md)
* [Crypto](crypto/README.md)
* [Fault injection](fi/README.md)
* [Misc](misc/README.md)
* [FridgeJIT](fridgejit/README.md)
